# Digit-recognition-using-Naive-Bayes
Digit recognition with Naive Bayes employs probability-based classification, assuming feature independence to identify handwritten digits accurately, often using datasets like MNIST. It calculates the likelihood of pixel values for each digit class to determine the most probable class for a given image.
